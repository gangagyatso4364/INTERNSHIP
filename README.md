#PROJECT: VOICE SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION USING ML

#COMPANY NAME:COMPSOFT TECHNOLOGIES

#TEAM NAME: APPLE

#PLATFORM USED: JUPYTER NOTEBOOK/KAGGLE

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Built a python application that analyses the sentiment behind the tone of the voice and predicts the
Sentiment involved, you can use an open source dataset for the same.

DATASETS:

1. [RAVDESS] (https://zenodo.org/record/1188976).

This dataset includes around 1500 audio file input from 24 different actors. 12 male and 12 female where these actors record short audios in 8 different emotions i.e 1 = neutral, 2 = calm, 3 = happy, 4 = sad, 5 = angry, 6 = fearful, 7 = disgust, 8 = surprised.<br>
Each audio file is named in such a way that the 7th character is consistent with the different emotions that they represent.

MODEL

Here we use deeplearning MLP to build a model. We could also use CNN or RNN.

FINAL OUTOUT:

We gave our own voice as an input to the model and made it predict the sentiment in voice.
